# PL-Project Fund BDA

## Problem to solve: 
Q. Does higher player spending in the transfer market, lead to better team ranking?

### Context:
The goal of this project was to find an answer as to whether money spent in the transfer market for premier league players, has resulted in a team increasing their league ranking.

### Data:
- The data used to analyze and solve this problem was taken from 2 online sites; https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/Premier-League-Stats, transfermarkt.us/premier-league/einnahmenausgaben/wettbewerb/GB1;  and put in an excel
- The data totaled to 20 years (2021-2002) of information showing the rank of a team and how much they spent in the transfer market per year. 
- The dataset was divided into 2 decades: Decade 1- (2021-2012), Decade2- (2011-2002)

### How to run
In order to run the Rscript you first need to:
- Download the excel files to your computer
- Then load the Rdataset attached onto your own Rscript
- Then go to files, click on the downloaded excel files and select "Import dataset"- from the pop up click on "sheet" and choose "Workbook"- then select 'Import.'
-Once completed; refer to the excel files, as seen in the written R Script and give them a name, preferably the one that is already there.
- Do this for both datasets (decade 1- 'Project Fund BDA original with leagues.xlsx', decade2- 'Fund BDA decade 2 project.xlsx') and  run each line using "ctrl + enter"
